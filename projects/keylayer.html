    <h1>KeyLayer</h1>

    <div class="project-hero keylayer-design"></div>

    <p>
        KeyLayer is a keyboard automation tool for people who looked at their keyboard and thought,
        “I could do less.” It turns your computer into a button-pressing machine that does all the
        boring parts for you—like typing, clicking, or having patience.
    </p>

    <p>
        It’s not a key remapper. It’s not just hotkeys. It’s more like:
        “What if this random $12 keypad controlled your job, your browser, and possibly everything else?”
    </p>

    <h2>Core Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Isolation:</strong> Pick any keyboard and make it invisible to Windows. It now answers only to you.</li>
        <li><strong>Visual Macro Editor:</strong> Flowchart-style node editor. Connect boxes. Watch things happen. No coding. Mostly. (This may break on some pcs)</li>
        <li><strong>Layer System:</strong> Multiple keymaps per device. Toggle them, hold them, switch contextually</li>
        <li><strong>Macro Actions:</strong> Keypresses, app launching, screenshots, mouse control, file opening, HTTP requests, logic branches, loop</li>
        <li><strong>Import/Export:</strong> JSON, XML, AutoHotkey, PowerShell (Might not work at all oops)/li>
        <li><strong>Macro Recorder:</strong> Press record. Harass your keyboard. Mess up the buffer system that took me wayy too long to do :D</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technical Stack</h2>
    <p>
        KeyLayer uses HidSharp for USB/HID communication, Newtonsoft.Json for the only normal JSON parsing experience,
        and WindowsAPICodePack to talk to Windows without completely offending it.
    </p>

    <div class="tech-used">
        <strong>Technologies:</strong> C#, .NET, WPF, HidSharp, Newtonsoft.Json, Windows API Code Pack
    </div>

    <h2>Automation That Actually Does Stuff</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Device-level control over which keyboard does what</li>
        <li>Multi-layer macros for maximum overengineering</li>
        <li>Live macro testing so you can break things in real time</li>
        <li>Undo/redo support for when you immediately regret your entire layout</li>
        <li>Encrypted profiles because I know what kind of person you are</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example Use Cases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gaming:</strong> Fire off three cooldowns and launch Spotify—all with one button</li>
        <li><strong>Productivity:</strong> Type “Hello, just following up…” without actually typing it ever again</li>
        <li><strong>Development:</strong> Press one key, open your IDE, run a script</li>
        <li><strong>QA/Enterprise:</strong> Automate form input until the form automates you</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Configuration Extras</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Themes: light, dark, and “meh” (may not work)</li>
        <li>Scan intervals and macro buffers for people who like sliders</li>
        <li>Debug logs that will either help or bully you</li>
        <li>Backups that mostly work (they don't)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Troubleshooting (Real Advice)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device not detected:</strong> Try plugging it in. Really plug it in. Mean it.</li>
        <li><strong>Isolation fails:</strong> Probably another app being territorial. Close stuff until it works.</li>
        <li><strong>Macro doesn’t trigger:</strong> Check bindings.</li>
        <li><strong>Lag:</strong> Adjust config. Pretend you understand it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Roadmap (Aspirational)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Plugin support</li>
        <li>Lua or Python support</li>
        <li>Linux/macOS support, eventually, probably, maybe</li>
    </ul>
