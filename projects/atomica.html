    <h1>Atomica</h1>

    <div class="project-hero atomica-design"></div>

    <p>
        A 2D particle simulator built in C# using MonoGame, because nothing screams ‚Äúproductive weekend‚Äù like simulating virtual dust specks being harassed around by gravity.
        Atomica lets you visualize basic Newtonian physics in real-time, with very intuitive controls (trust).
    </p>

    <h2>Features That Definitely Exist</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Real-time 2D particle simulation (yep, things move)</li>
        <li>Change gravity direction with the arrow keys (truly groundbreaking)</li>
        <li>Toggle cursor-following mode, if you want the particles to chase your mouse like needy toddlers</li>
        <li>Resizable window support (unless your machine says "no")</li>
        <li>Built-in instructions rendered with System.Drawing because why not</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
        Atomica is powered by MonoGame, the framework of choice for people who enjoy writing their own physics engine instead of using Unity like a normal person.
        The particles follow basic Newtonian physics, meaning they accelerate due to gravity, bounce off walls, and sometimes just decide to ignore the laws of physics if your code is bad (oops).
    </p>

    <div class="tech-used">
        <strong>Technologies:</strong> C#, MonoGame, System.Drawing
    </div>

    <h2>Controls</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Arrow Keys:</strong> Change gravity direction. North? South? Your call.</li>
        <li><strong>Spacebar:</strong> Toggle whether the particles follow your cursor. It's like being a wizard, but with fewer consequences.</li>
        <li><strong>Esc:</strong> Quits the application (What more do you want).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Installation (No, It's Not On Steam)</h2>
    <p>
        Download the installation package from the repo's releases tab
    </p>

    <p>
        Then run the .exe inside (If it doesn't work then please hesitate to contact me)
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Exists</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>It‚Äôs fun to watch particles bounce around and pretend you‚Äôre doing science.</li>
        <li>You‚Äôll learn about MonoGame, physics</li>
        <li>Makes a decent screensaver if you leave it running long enough (it doesn't).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üôè Thanks, I Guess</h2>
    <p>
        GameDev Quickie for tutorials that made me realize I could done everything much quicker if I actually knew what I was doing (surely).
