    <h1>Gorilla Warfare</h1>

    <div class="project-hero gorilla-design"></div>

    <p>
        A multiplayer FPS where everyone plays as a gorilla. It’s technically functional and very low effort.
        Built in Unity over the course of a week, mostly to refresh my knowledge on Photon PUN networking.
    </p>

    <h2>Gameplay Summary</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Multiplayer lobby system using Photon PUN</li>
        <li>Host-controlled match starting</li>
        <li>Custom room names and usernames</li>
        <li>Basic FPS movement: WASD, Jump, Sprint, Shoot</li>
        <li>Scoreboard tracking kills and deaths</li>
        <li>Red bullet impact squares that vanish after 30 seconds, for realism</li>
        <li>Gravity-enabled death via falling into the void</li>
        <li>Permanent T-posing gorilla player models, for atmosphere</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
    <p>
        Created in Unity using Photon PUN for networked multiplayer. The lobby system supports room listing,
        joining, naming, and host-based game control. A somehwat goofy FPS controller manages player input and shooting.
        Enemies do not exist. Everyone is the same gorilla. There are no teams. No win condition. Only meaningless violence.
    </p>

    <h2>Design Notes</h2>
    <p>
        The map consists of ramps and walls. There is a gun. It makes no sound, but you’ll know it fired because
        a red square will appear briefly where the bullet hit. The T-posing gorillas are not placeholders. They are the vision.
    </p>

    <h2>Audio</h2>
    <p>
        There is one song, which plays in the main menu. That’s it. No sound effects.

    <h2>Future Plans (Surely I actually do something)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Boss fights (unclear what against)</li>
        <li>Multiplayer modes that go beyond “everyone shoots everyone”</li>
        <li>New maps, maybe ones that aren’t just ramps and voids</li>
        <li>SFX, probably</li>
        <li>Gorillas that don’t T-pose (low priority)</li>
    </ul>
