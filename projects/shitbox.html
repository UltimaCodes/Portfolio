    <h1>Sumo Robot (His name is pablo escrowbar)</h1>

    <div class="project-hero robot-design"></div>

    <p>
        A Bluetooth-controlled sumo robot that weighs 3.5kg (How is it still working)
        Built with an ESP32, a welded aluminum chassis, and a very funny 24V battery that almost set my 
        schoolbag on fire (oops)
    </p>

    <h2>Hardware Summary</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>ESP32, because I like the unpredictable pairing issues</li>
        <li>24V battery pack (probably too much, but it works)</li>
        <li>Two buck converters:
            <ul>
                <li>12V → motor drivers</li>
                <li>5V → ESP32 (the brain, allegedly)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Two BTS7960 motor drivers, because if something’s going to catch fire, it might as well be powerful</li>
        <li>Two high torque, low speed motors mounted with “custom” welded brackets</li>
        <li>Chassis made of aluminum sheets (Might have gotten scammed)</li>
        <li>Front scooper welded at a 40° angle. It does not flex.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Control System</h2>
    <p>
        Controlled via Bluetooth using a generic app (keypad that sends integers and updates booleans)
        Range is adequate but it has pairing issues which make it a hassle to use competitively 
        Also we might have ruined the battery like 4 times
    </p>

    <h2>Power Delivery</h2>
    <p>
        The 24V battery feeds into two buck converters.
        One drops to 12V to feed the motor drivers. The other drops to 5V to keep the ESP32 awake long enough
        to crash into things. No overcurrent protection. No fuse. Should have added something like that (oops).
    </p>

    <h2>Performance</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Top speed: 3~ m/s</li>
        <li>Pushing Force: 50N~</li>
        <li>Bluetooth stability: works like 4 times out of 10</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Testing Footage (Unreleased, for a reason)</h2>
    <p>
        Most testing consisted of ramming the robot into a box, a wall, and my own foot. Success was defined
        by whether the robot still turned on afterward. The robot did, in fact, not turn on for the first 10 tries.
        It took us a month and a funny loss in a competition due to battery failure to actually fix the robot.
    </p>

    <h2>Future Plans</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Redesign the chassis with a heavier core in mind</li>
        <li>Auto-targeting (read: guess and shove)</li>
        <li>A flipper in the slope</li>
        <li>A Battery that actually has a BMS</li>
        <li>Custom App with commands (Like spinning cw or ccw, dashing, etc)</li>
    </ul>
